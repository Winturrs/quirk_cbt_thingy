I would like to spend my time with the people who have CBT. Like, I would always want to be there for the person and make them feel comfortable and wanted. Give them a feeling that they should be in the present right now and not stay in the past and but still not in the future. Even if the person with CBT doesn't want to feel comforted and just wanted to be all, I'd still want to try and be there for that person making sure that they are okay and safe. 

If I wanted to hangout with someone who has CBT, I'd want to figure out what they like to do. It could be having lunch, playing games, listening to music, anything would to make sure that they are having a fun time and possibly to distract them from CBT.
